I got rid of FB a while ago. I despise that platform. I loathe the position of people saying, "if you have nothing to hide it shouldn't matter." It does matter because the data is being used for far more nefarious purposes than most realize. Having nothing to hide isn't the point, our fundamental right to privacy is what is at stake and the constitution is being treated like a doormat. ### Facebook and Zuckerberg are evil. And all the zombie lemmings that aren't capable of thinking for themselves pollute the world. ### most of us still think about this "privacy" is not a big issue, especially in my country. 80% of People rely on facebook too much as an information center Wanna know what kinds of thing could be changed their mind ? ### Facebook is nothing but Lifelog DARPA ### Everybody thinks if you get rid of Facebook and other things ..they can't watch you ..that is bull they still watch you. ### I quit Facebook to. That Zuckin platform Is EVIL. I don‚Äôt think Zucker is a real HUMAN!!!! ### Quite honestly I don't do social media I think Facebook and Twitter and all the other ones are just for stupid people to have a voice second if I haven't talked to you in 20 years there's probably a reason for that I want to talk to you now in third if they're truly is a Skynet good cuz computers are logical they're going to go after the people that have f***** s*** up like all the politicians and the rest of the assholes long before they go after normal people that aren't a threat so I good luck to all the assholes in the world you're going to need it ### So what if we all get rid of our phones ... Does it go much deeper than that!!! ### facebook is spying on you they have tools that the cops and newspapers and governments have access too to read your page just ask zerohedge or the dailymail ### Thanks for this insightful video. The sad thing is that there is absolutely not a single thing any of us can do about it except for shutting down, turning off and for those who have the desire and strength to do so... get rid of our devices. That's it! Over time we have been slowly lured into the life of thinking and believing that we need these machines when we truly don't. My close circle of family and friends have taken pride in turning them off at family get-togethers - leaving them in a basket at the front door of the home upon entry; or simply just not bringing them with us on trips. Girlfriends and I will notify family and friends when we are heading out for the night or a cottage trip and will leave them behind for the weekend - and we have been fine, just fine!¬† Our parents, grandparents and great grandparents got on just fine without them. We can too! There's no way out of this unless we decide NOT to participate. ### I deleted fb and ditched mobile phones 10 years ago, and i havent used my bank for longer than that :) ### Just think about the future! No privacy, no precise control over your own device! Yeah, Fighting for privacy is what we all need to do. ### We need to start an analog society. We need to completely rid ourselves of our dependency on ARPANET. There is no other solution. ### I am off facebook and social media platforms for years now. I mean, my customers, that was or is on facebook, get adverisements while they are in my business premises from my competition!!! Basically social media tracks my customers, and gives them advertisements based where they are. I pay for my business property, and social media thinks it is ok to "come into" my front door and take my customers? I dont have the money of the bigger corporations to pay facebook or google to advertise my brand. I have to phone and email to get new customers. ### Zuck the NWO!!! ### If you speak about other social networks on the blue social network with an F, they will be hidden. In fact if you tell people on trash book that you're moving to mewe, rumble, etc your friends will never see it unless you are under their radar. I know tons of people that had to physically tell others they left because they weren't permitted to notify others of this when they left for mewe. Its like an abusive boy/girlfriend you keep going back to. Many have also begin using duck duck go. What can we use in place of goggle maps if you know please comment below. ### Why can't I share this on Facebook ### I got kicked off FB & Messenger. It figures. I share truthful information ### Want privacy? Get out of the internet or use it anonymously! There is simply no other way! ### PRIVACY IS PRECIOUS SOCIALISING IS PRECIOUS WE NEED BALANCE AND SOCIAL MEDIA TAKES PEOPLE TO EXTREME EXPOSURE AND ISOLATION. ### It's already too late children today are born with iPads and cell phones in their hands tick tock YouTube Facebook Instagram and God knows what else they're absolutely addicted and so am I ### We're past the point of no return people! been this way a while now.. you don't like it now wait another 5 years. you won't even want to live anymore. thanks to our own technology. some of it can seem good for us like we need it.. but the bad you don't even want to know about, or what it will lead to.. it outweighs the good. just look around! this current younger gen is already completely destroyed! "our future leaders of the world" ### Facebook used to collect Metadata, Now they are Meta & collecting all sorts of Data... ### You can add that Fake Book promotes ads influencing parents/guardians to sign their children up to learn code writing. Especially for writing codes for gaming and making avatars. Um no thanks! ### Facebook is the creation of the c.i.a. and there pilot program lifelog ### Fighting for privacy is what we all need to do. ### I love this guy, because this is also my point of vieuw! Let's fight back to get our privacy. If you are okay with getting no privacy, are you okay with an eye on you 24/7 and i mean ANYTIME & ANYWHERE? So for the people who still not care imagine if you realize your being watched on the toilet, in your bed, your private coversations... If you are okay with that i consider you crazy! Who the heck knows what google and facebook is up too and what kind of employees they hire. I'm assuring you they will hire people with some kind of evil in them. So no matter what happens DONT give your privacy away like it's a piece or penny. ### So you're saying, if we want to be free, leave our phones at home, and don't buy anything they don't like? What don't they like to trigger them? How can we all group to talk? Like antifa,...they just come together on situations?...in all they're minds, telepathically? Where are theses super computers or places they collect our info? Just another video saying we can do nothing just because of our own technology to make lives simple. When we just want to be left alone. Nothing but control. ### We feed a whole lot of unnecessary information out there it lost it was proposed by the tech's to education and knowledge not this crapy information about junkies for people's put porno on it. ### This is why I advise everyone in Australia not to vote for government party's who support such strong restrictions and policy's on internet as this is a vilacion of our privacy and and fredem of speech ### Seems all the web turned to garbage after digital melenium act. ### Absolutely love this guy, totally agree about FB!! ### It's very sad how companies and governments will happily sacrifice our privacy for their own goals. ### "What the Zuck" needs a companion expression, like "Aww Twit" ### We can only hope everyone stops voting government party's that support these policies that invad our privacy and freedom of speech as this is a government that is a dictatorship ### I've always wondered, are my friends do this too, at some point this this phone really doesn't leave the house. We only have one phone so that's it when I go I'm without. But this phone will out of nowhere scream you know a sound and I've always wondered if whoever whatever is checking to see where that phone's at tracking me or tracking the phone. I always stay in hot water with Facebook I only keep it cuz my husband likes to whatever what up keep up with the old Tommy people who did monster stuff you don't know go see you know them people that movie people and movies whatever and our son who passed away his page other than that I don't give a rats behind because I have emotional triggers and they will say thanks I don't trust cultures let's say. Because I've been told all my life through movies and news stories you can't trust certain cultures you know the very very very rich I'd like to go all the oil on one side of the Earth. Then the others I do not trust used to be on by UK and they finally left to come down country that's the ones who call and try to scam you which they hacked my computer that on my pictures thank goodness I had also memory thing of Bob's I got some pictures I don't have them all, and I don't trust my own government. So anyways I'll say a little something smart like that and I get I guess forever band because now if I say something Facebook l i t e, they say thank you but the admins will review comment. So I used to go blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and even to me they got boring. I wanted right here. ### No social media for me.. ### Yes. the internet with FaceCrook & Boogle are listening and watching us. ### I wish I could turn off my phone unfortunately I need it for my job ### All The more reason to leave the internet!!!why can‚Äôt people see this!!!!! Your paying for a plastic tracking device!!! That phone is a government tracking device and your paying for it !!!!!!!!!! Wake up !!!!!! ### üëèüëèüëè they're selling our informations ### i've been with google so long i'd loose so many things it's a toss up loose everything or no privacy i never take my phone outta the house actually 1st time ive owned one in ten years i h8 watching ppl on their phone sitting with ppl with no phones weird but i didn't like them. now i have to have one if u loose anything on ur computer emails a fb accts google account u can't get them bk anymore without a text number. fuking bullshit. so its stil a house phone it stays here never take it anywhere no use 4 it. ### So we just not protect no privacy ### It is an evolving problem that is a slippery slope and one we won't be able to climb back from without a lot of sacrifice and pain. They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Unfortunately, as David said convenience wins, The consequences are not real for most people till it is too late. it sucks to have to fight for your own privacy. like Rob said it is a losing battle. One that won't just effect us but our descendants for generations. ### DESTROY THE SMARTPHONE NOW! all of them. ### Someone kill Comcast... ### what the zuck lol i kikt failbook out in 2017 any new device all FB files get force stopped and scrubbed ### Right at @5:00 as he explains how mentioning Facebook triggers the YouTube algorithm, an ad for Meta (Facebook's parent company) comes on. Now we have the proof Skynet is watching. ### thank you both for this, youtub and facebook will not let me say much at all. ### I got rid ov all social media other then YT. But they also listen in. I was talking about something then a few minutes later YT was showing me videos on the subject. Scary sh*t people.
