QUERY:the government needs to stop being so courupt COMMENTS:Im sure we can trust the govt to be honest with us. ### Irresponsible government ### Who still trusts our government? ### This Democrat administration is trying to cover this up and blame it on Trump. Dirty crooks ### Expect more of this... this is what a collapsing society/country looks like. ### So now what the government have to say to the people about this is a ufo, fake news like always the government do to try to no one talk about this problem? ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤« ### Do not drink the water until politicians drink in national TV.. ### Mayor Bootytime needs to go ASAP! ### US government is focusing on harmless balloons more than this catastrophic damages to environment - SHAME on you ### So this happens 10 days ago....and mainstream news was silent. If this does not wake people up about the fake censoring news media, nothing will. Shame on MSNBC CNN ABC etc. Wake up America and take back your country, because it seems your elite swampy Democrats and swamp rat Rep are more concerned with the money they are making personally off Ukraine and dwindling taxpayer funds, while you need help at home. Disgusting immoral mainstream news. ### What's to investigate? Look what they just did to railworkers. Add in layoffs, lax safety measures, wall street greed. This country is doomed ### This is why US govt and its main stream media keep hyping up the issue of flying objects and balloons is to divert the world attention away from their terror act of blasting the Nord Stream pipelines and also from this covered up train derailment disaster which exposed large toxic chemical to the air. ### Once again the American government sweep it under the table...the media have one report...one FFS! Meanwhile residents are being sick, have skin rashes, problems breathing... but " oh no it's all under control, nothing to see here... please get cancer and keep quiet Ohio residents, everything is fine...I hope that they all get lawyered up fast! ### Democrats and Biden administration plan this control train derailed ### They return home to get cancer. That place is now a qualifier for superfund status and the government trivializes the magnitude of the situation ### Tell me you're trying to cover your @$$ for idiotically handling this situation, without telling me you're trying to cover your @$$ for idiotically handling this situation.... Of course these laywers are now going after the Railroad company! They chose to handle this situation by burning toxic chemicals and calling it a controled burn, which is the dumbest idea ever. Now the morons in charge of handling this got called out on their stupidity and are now backtracking, in order to try to save face. Give me a break! This is not the railroads fault! These morons can spend millions and billions of dollars protecting other countries and illegal immigrants, yet point fingers because they can't take any accountability for their actions.... its pathetic and sad... but in all reality, its really not surprising these days..... ### They shouldve cleaned it up, instead of blowing it up... ### The EPA giving the all clear for these people to return home is wrong, these people will eventually get really sick from the toxic materials still present. How does our government allow this to happen. ### People should not return to this place yet ### Seriously you guys are covering up whatâ€™s really going on. Water is contaminated, animals dying, and the plum of toxic chemicals. Questions..,. Where is the president, FEMMA, Red Cross, or even Pete B, what the heck.. thanks for the passing word spiel. ### JUST LIKE USUAL THE GOVERNMENT TELLS PEOPLE IT IS SAFEâ€¦.FLINT WATER WAS DEEMED SAFE AS WELLâ€¦WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THEREâ€¦. ### Don't worry, the USA government will send more weapons and billions of dollars to Ukraine and ignore this domestic disaster as we worry about balloons.. I mean ufos in the sky. ### ðŸ†˜ Shame on Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, the EPA and Norfolk Southern railroad for the way they mishandled the toxic train derailment in East Palastine, Ohio.They need to compensate all the people living there for damages and possibly relocate them out of the toxic waste zone they created. They need to tell the truth to this poor people and help them. ### Community should hire 3rd party lab to test the contaminated soil,air,water. ### do not drink the water please ### THEY ARE OKAY WITH INJECTING POISON INTO PEOPLEâ€¦.I GUESS SENDING PEOPLE TO A CONTAMINATED AREA IS NOTHING FOR THIS GOVERNMENTâ€¦.. ### That town is screwed. Itâ€™s time for them to move. Remove all the dirt in the town down to 10 feet and fill with new dirt. ### I hope the company gets sued ### " There are too many white people cleaning this up." -Mayor Pete ### Any intelligent human being: "Maybe we should bury the toxic chemicals in an asorbtive medium to contain it, like we've done with every other toxic chemical spill in history." Insane anti-human government: "No, we're going to explode it into the air to cause the maximum amount of contamination possible since it would look too bad if we dumped it directly into the river." ### Capitalism as usual. ### horrible ### Well is is what rail infrastructure privatisation does, we railfans, who know the abysmal state that the us rail network is in, have been warning for about this for years, but we were ignored and cast aside ass communist. ### Rates of cancer will increase in that area but people have no choice but to go back home bc nobody wants to pay for people to have safe shelter somewhere else. This country I swear sometimes itâ€™s so evil ### Need to follow up with consequences of the chemical leak ### This could have been fixed if rail wasn't privatized or if unions had more power in the rail industry. Standards fell significantly in braking technology after the rail companies lobbied to have restrictions lifted or relaxed. They got their way. Unions asked for sick pay and were denied and forced back to work. ### Yeah go ahead return to your toxic home and get some weird cancer in a couple years from forever chemicals. I'd stay away and get ahold of a really good lawyer (Erin Brochovich) to represent the town's people. You guys need to sell your homes to the railroad. It's not like they don't have the money, 800 billion in stock buy backs last year. Going back is to put a nail in your own coffin. Find someone who loves you to stay with them, cause it will take a few years to sue them for what they've done to you. ### Ohio was hit with a biological weapon terrorist attack a inside job depop in full swing ### Please no ### AOC IS MORE OUTRAGED BY GAS STOVES THEN THIS POISON UNLEASHED ON THE INNOCENT PEOPLEâ€¦..IT IS ALL FAKE TO DRAIN PEOPLE OF MORE TAX MONEYâ€¦.GRIFTERS GOING TO GRIFT AS USUALâ€¦â€¦ ### "Controlled" ### China do this ### This was an aerial attack by China. The train derailment was our governmentâ€™s feeble attempt at covering up the chemical attack by aerial balloon by communist China. This is also why biden has been shooting all of these other legitimate objects down. China is attacking the US right now with chemical balloons. WAKE UP, PEOPLE. ### it amazes the people trust the so called experts after flint michigan. i wouldn't step foot in ohio ### So called developed country USA has been damaging environment since last two centuries. At the same they accuse India and China for green house gas emissions ### Coming to a town near you. ### What now? ### Why wasnâ€™t this train split up and done in 2 runs rather than this shitshow - total bastardry ### Why doesn't msnbc talk about this rather than play a slide? Oh yeah thats right. This county voted 71% for Donald Trump in 2020. I think the EPA should drink that water that has been cleared by them to drink and we should wait to see what happens to them. Love Canal 2.0? Also where are all the climate czars on this if they care so much for the climate? ### Did the president do a press conference on this? ..oh. Only shootings to try and disarm the good American
