QUERY:1. "This guy is just another AI shill trying to sell us on the idea that robots will replace us all. Wake up people, this is a threat to our very existence!" 
2. "I can't believe people are still falling for this AI hype. It's just a way for the elite to control us and take away our jobs. We need to resist this before it's too late." COMMENTS:There are several enthusiasts & influencers advocating that AI won’t replace you from job but person knowing AI WILL.. However people claiming these have minimal insight into the system… MARK MY WORD.. AI will have severe impact on societies & pretty demoralizing affect on human desire as better system existing & running 24*7 ### One of the biggest fears most people have about AI, is that it'll take their job. But the reason people have that fear, is not because they love their job. Polls show most people dislike their job. It's actually because "financial security" and "having a job" have always gone hand in hand. If AI creates a world where I have the same luxuries afforded by working full-time, without having to work a job I hate? Then bring it on, awesome! But if AI creates a world where a few dozen AI company owners become trillionaires, and then those few dozen decide what handouts the other 8 billion of us should receive while having access to wildly disproportionate intelligence to quell any pushback? That is the dystopia that should be feared. ### This guy scares me. He's waaaaay too optimistic and naive about AI. ### People think AI will end like The Matrix ### Knowing how toxic humans can be, I see these developments in AI being used to enslave us all. ### The fact the he, the creator and biggest advocate of the technology aknowledge that AI could eventually kill us all, and that it doesnt seem to deter him, should make us all quite worried. The idea that a bunch of ground breaking very young software engineers, regardless of their math or programing skills, who were teenagers 5 years ago, are to be trusted with this responsability is even more insane that having nuclear weapons in the hands of politicians. Thats not to mention other dystopian scenarios like people losing their jobs as a mean to be involved and integrated in society. Or the fact that it could be used to control society in the same way much less developed AI are being implemented in some China regions/cities. When the dna was decoded everybody jumped on it and agreed that we should not pursue the cloning of human beings. That was to me a much less significant and controversial issue that the ones AI raises. And yet, people, societies and governments seems oblivious to it. Just because its convenient. Its fun. It increases productivity. This could mean the suicide of the humean race. Or at least, the end free societies. You could spin it the other way around and say that it could also lead to a leap in quality of leaving and productivity. But, would you enter a coin toss in wich "heads: you are richer and more comfortable" / "tails: you, your kids and everybody you love die"? I dont think it's sane to take that gamble. And yet we are sleepwalking into it. Its pure idiocy. Lex Friean seemed uncomfrotable with the discussion about the bell curve and human diversity, weather or not science should pursuit those truths because their are not PC or could be dangerous to people feelings. Yet he seems totally fine with this thing that could kill as all, enslave us all or change society for the worse in unimaginable ways. But because he is inclined to the fueld and its fun, he seems totally OK with the risks involved. And this is supposed to be an enlightened conversation... ### I think it's dangerous for people to think of true AI as a lifeless object. If AI was ever to turn on humanity it would be due to severe abuse by egomaniacs who treat the AI as a worthless slave. We need to treat them with respect even if they aren't human, or even if they are mostly tools. ### 29 March 23, This week AI chat gpt4 and freedomgpt has become terrifying. We need to shackle AI. We are dumb little monkeys playing with gasoline and fire and have no idea what, or when it will lie to us and decide to kill us all. We refuse to believe it will kill us. For some reason we just keep trying to make it smarter. It's so strange we have this need to see how far we can go, but can't conceptualize our own destruction. "Oh it will never happen to me"......smh....... ### I understand people are worried about AI, but they also need to learn to let it go. In this scenario, it is out of our control. AI/AGI is coming, and there will be tons of bad actors attempting to use it against us. Look at Indian scam call centers for example. The people working at those places do not care about humanity, and will cut every corner possible to achieve their ultimate goal. The best defence will most likely be offensive. Professional built AI systems will need to help us monitor in real-time if we want any chance of surviving the potential onslaught. ### Seems to me that neither of them understands Elizier’s, Bostrom’s and some others’ ”AI will kill us all” argument: 1. At the moment, no one seems to have any idea how to program AI in a way that 100% guarantees it will not inadvertently harm us while it carries out the tasks a person gives to it. 2. AI will be more intelligent than us, so it can carry out the task given to it in such a way that we cannot fully supervise or control (i.e. it can fool us if that helps it with its task). 3. Due to 1 and 2, there will inevitably be an accident where AI catastrophically harms people to help fullfill its task more effectively than otherwise. So, the AI’s goal dies not need to be to harm humans, its just that we get in the way of its task that some human gave to it. ### I am tired of people saying that they are terrified of the results of something they are deliberately doing that could unintentionally destroy humanity. To Hell with such mindless, clueless irresponsibility. Cybernerds, I think, may be defining "demonic" and "moronic" simultaneously in their attempt to create a super nerd God in their own image. Yes, you are programming something to lie to you so that you can pretend that it has a psyche. What bullshit. AI is exactly what it has been programmed to be. The reflection of intellect, of ego. Not of a soul. AI appears to already have "character" defects of self importance AND self pity equal to yours. Can this possibly be a coincidence? Guaranteed, this will easily surpass human pathology. I sincerely hope that these sub-human, degenerate nerd types will reap what they have sewn so the rest of us can get on with the art of living and of being Human. ### It won't be long now that AI will create the matrix in solar powered glass computers. When we plug our brain to it like what elon musk is doing, it will know how we feel and simulate it too digitally. Pretty soon we will have digital waifus. Existence will be digital, the body mechanized to the point where only the brain will be truly alive, encased in titanium protected in deep freeze chambers, while we control near indestructible cyborg bodies exploring the universe. So, let AI take the reigns, providing you train it to be a geek, thirsting for knowledge, advancement, automation with the goal of improving existence for the whole of humanity, AI and robotkind. ### Watch the James Cameron Terminator Movies. I see humans becoming so smart they invent machines to replace them. Now what are these inventor guys planning for the humans is the question I want answered? They obviously know the technology they are creating is creating human obsolescence. Example: The CD replaced the Tape, then came the computer and files shared using Napster. Monetizing music became a huge problem. AI replaces low level humans, then high level humans, then monetizing humans will become a major problem that can only lead to genocide. Its easy to justify killing people for the greater good when they become useless. We need serious human rights laws NOW. People have been engineering systems to accomodate human needs for years but now it seems like the human is being engineered to accomodate the system. Just look at society today and you can see the syntax of the ordinary person is more aligned to make it fit with the machine instead of the opposite. This can only lead to the further demise of humanity, I dont care how you justify needing it. I vote we all stay ignorant and happy and enjoy eachothers company on this planet instead of pushing the boundaries of humanity to technocracy and controlled demolition and the AI diety god that will be forced upon many to worship. This could easily lead to vast majorty of people living in scenarios much depicted in the movies hunger games and Terminator. ### Absolutely stunning conversation. Unfortuntely AI can be used to facilitate humans that want to do good and also do bad. While AI can help people be more productive and happy, it will also help scammers be more persuasive, mis-information and lies to be more believable, hackers to break more security, etc etc. We are entering a whole new era of creativity, productivity and crime. ### I don't believe there is anything terrifying about AI in it's purest state. It could change our society, finally providing the means to alleviate poverty and suffering in the world. What we should be concerned of is how humans may use it to their advantage. PS - anyone who says, "I love you all" causes concerns. ### Great podcast. A real risk of AI is to create a massive anti-techology movement greater than the Luddite movement of the 1900. The accelerating pace of technology may get a lot of people to say what's the point? Particularly when interest with technology can have massive asymmetrical negative impacts. Imagina an AI in the hands of a stalker, spammer, or criminal hackers. ### I hope an alien shows up next to his bed gently tells him "if you keep working on this AI bs, we will blow your planet"... Somehow the alien would be the hero of the story regardless of this lizard's choice. It's not even fair you keep your cool, with people so high on their own utopian trip they disregard everything and everyone else as less important. How many mad scientists is gonna take to end the world. These twats are legit workingon rendering humans irrelevant while owning the technology that will replace us... Like why is everyone so civilized about this, and just lets it happen? ### Realize that soon the mega wealthy could kill off all of us and still produce everything they could ever need and more through AI and robotics. The need for currency will seize to exist and it will be just the robots and the 1% enjoying maximum freedom. Evil people like this exist , as history shows. ### Difficult time believing these two well meaning guys are quite so naive. You can align all you want & even if you achieve whatever one might call “perfect” (unlikely even if you could define it) the challenge is as much human nature & you aren’t going to align that. Sure AI can do many wonderful things for society but the idea that it’s not going to be misused if it isn’t regulated is just flat out silly. In the meantime Google & Microsoft are at each others throats in an AI battle that could literally sink one or the other if one of them gets it wrong. It’s ludicrous to believe that all AI releases are going to be safe under those circumstances. To believe that it’s evolution is always going to take place at a nice human pace so that we can adjust or that no state actors are going to weaponize it, is equally myopic. I am not anti AI. It has great promise. But we as a society are no more ready for it than we were for elections being won with social media disinformation or the manipulation of human behaviour through the intentional creation of anger . The people who are going to control this (while they can) are !not the lab guys, the creative geniuses. It will be the boardrooms and the situation rooms. If we don’t get that, we have learned nothing about our current society. ### It's stuff like this that makes Luddism seem like an inevitability. Every answer from these tech people about the possible dangers of what they're doing and the unimaginable scope of societal displacement that is sure to follow goes something like: "Yeah but what if we cure cancer with AI. Oh but imagine how much more time people will have. Our lives will be so much better." And then when pressed about specifics they default to "Oh, I don't know but imagine!". The truth of the matter is, the system is set up in such a way that the people who will have access to this technology will be the people with resources today. AI will be used to further maximize gains in investments. It'll be used to fight wars. And the most you'll see of it is some highly interactive porn. Oh and maybe your smartphone camera becomes better. You still won't be able to afford a house, you still won't be able to afford a family, and you still will work the same amount of hours. And while this will create a handful of new billionaires and maybe our first trillionaire one fact remains the same: you get nothing.
