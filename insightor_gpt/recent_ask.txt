QUERY:1. "Revolution? More like we need a complete overhaul of the AI industry. These chatbots are just a distraction from the real issues at hand."
2. "You think we need more revolution? Wake up and smell the dystopian future we're heading towards. AI is only going to make things worse for humanity." COMMENTS:AI can revolutionize humanity. I also believe it can destroy it. I'm glad to see there are open conversations about this hurdle. I believe that in the right scenario, AI can bring true world peace. ### The arrogance and greed of these so called tech geniuses, who are now developing history’s most disruptive and dangerous technology, is unreal. If anything poses an existential threat to our society, we the people, who will be affected, should have a say as to whether these technologies are ultimately a net good or bad for humanity. Just look at the impact of the smartphone and social media. They have changed many things over the last 15 years, and I would argue, as a father and concerned IT professional, they have had serious negative consequences on our children and on our world. To close access to the code for Open AI and have a 37 year old CEO say only he and his company know what is best for the future of 7 billion people, is both foolish and dangerous. Both Microsoft and Open AI are driven by money and power. Governments should step in and regulate these tech corporations, there should be rigorous studies, discussions and normal people voting on these issues before these companies destroy humanity in the name of profits. ### Two AIs talking about AI ### It's stuff like this that makes Luddism seem like an inevitability. Every answer from these tech people about the possible dangers of what they're doing and the unimaginable scope of societal displacement that is sure to follow goes something like: "Yeah but what if we cure cancer with AI. Oh but imagine how much more time people will have. Our lives will be so much better." And then when pressed about specifics they default to "Oh, I don't know but imagine!". The truth of the matter is, the system is set up in such a way that the people who will have access to this technology will be the people with resources today. AI will be used to further maximize gains in investments. It'll be used to fight wars. And the most you'll see of it is some highly interactive porn. Oh and maybe your smartphone camera becomes better. You still won't be able to afford a house, you still won't be able to afford a family, and you still will work the same amount of hours. And while this will create a handful of new billionaires and maybe our first trillionaire one fact remains the same: you get nothing. ### Absolutely stunning conversation. Unfortuntely AI can be used to facilitate humans that want to do good and also do bad. While AI can help people be more productive and happy, it will also help scammers be more persuasive, mis-information and lies to be more believable, hackers to break more security, etc etc. We are entering a whole new era of creativity, productivity and crime. ### technological revolution and advancements have always replaced mundane jobs i.e factory jobs doing manual labor replaced by robotics and automation etc everything is cyclical. customer service jobs for example being replaced by AI or AGI in the near future or in max. 50 years cab drivers being replaced by autonomous driving is bound to happen and in the process new, more intellectually challenging less physically challenging jobs will be created and the need for being intelligent and educated will see an uptick as not keeping up with new tech. advancements will make you feel too dated too soon. like a grandfather trying to use an iPhone for the first time. however, i do believe eventually AI & AGI will be smarter than humans and just like how 10,000 years ago physical endurance and strength was far more valuable than human intelligence capabilities, no healthcare or meds, surviving in the wild outdoors, I believe in another 10,000 years human biological intelligence won't be as important either with the help of AI. perhaps become like Wall-E lol (jk) ### People think AI will end like The Matrix ### There are several enthusiasts & influencers advocating that AI won’t replace you from job but person knowing AI WILL.. However people claiming these have minimal insight into the system… MARK MY WORD.. AI will have severe impact on societies & pretty demoralizing affect on human desire as better system existing & running 24*7 ### "The increase in quality of life that AI can deliver" I honest see this going the other way rapidly. The destructive force of capitalism will enable those of means to leverage AI for more and more while those without means are crushed beyond poverty. I once heard entrepreneurship described as a carnival game and the more tries you could afford the more likely you are win the prize. AI is going to be another game where those who can afford the most tries will monopolize the finite rewards. As long as we allow unbridled capitalism, technology and productivity tools will continue increasing wealth inequality and the median standard of living will continue degrading. ### At some point in the future, AI will make better companions than actual humans, and I mean that in more than just in a platonic way. The end of human jobs is one thing, but the end of human relationships is going to be a way bigger blow to humanity. That's when there's no going back. ### There is a tone of suppressed realism in these conversations that twists my stomach. If you’ve been dreaming about something since you were eight years old, it’s likely that you are pretty committed to the optimistic version of that thing. Maybe you are willfully ignorant of any signs that it’s headed in a bad direction. For example- in all of human history, no advances have resulted in a widespread improvement in quality of life. We just increase the upper end of the range and leave more people at the bottom. If we can’t agree on ways to even try to mitigate climate change, how the hell are we going to gain consensus on AI? There doesn’t seem to be anyone who truly understand this technology who views the implications with total objectivity. Scary. I’m off to doomsday prep. ### I feel that reinforcement learning may inadvertently exacerbate the problem of living inside one's own echo chamber. ie. to reinforce what someone already agrees with or likes to hear. It's imperative that we use AI to assist us both in matters of material efficiency but also for spiritual growth. The seeming truth of the matter is that people, at present, lack the wisdom to use AI in ways that aren't foolish, self-serving, and harmful. This problem has to be addressed in the coming decades if we want to use technology in manners which wont destroy us. ### 34:35 "There is a large number of things that we don't significantly disagree on, but there's also a large number of things that we disagree on. What's an AI supposed to do?..." Focus on principle. The answer is the same for what a human is supposed to do. We operate an economic system apparently without regard for Truth as a primary value. (We don't require that industries account for externalities so that prices show some measure of environmental costs and profits align with sustainability. AI will be used to promote profitability of businesses. That profitability in the current context is based on lies. It is based on the fact that corporations can offer their goods and services at prices that hide pollution and depletion costs. (The solution to the paperclip problem is to make computer algorithms pay for the resources they call on. The solution to an unsustainable society is to make industries pay in proportion to how much they pollute or deplete natural resources.) I want to rent a robot that has an audio interface with ChatGPT that will help me pass out essays that say how to end poverty and promote sustainability. (Charge fees to industries for pollution, etc., then share fee proceeds to all.) ### I wish they focused more on the opportunities being created and the positive aspects of this new technology, as most of this interview is about the fear of the future. We need more examples of how to personally take advantage of AI to improve our lives and the world around us. ### if there were a pro/com list of ChatGPT-4 the con list would be as long as War and Peace and the Pro list would may be be 5 benefits. The American Public's lizard brain like the toilet paper "phenomenon" when Covid began and when people were killing people over a Popeyes chicken sandwich, that is a big precursor of what is to come. If you think deep fakes are dangerous, this is deep fakes on nuclear steroids. A bunch of anti-social nerds are literally defining the future of information and conversing with others. The irony in that alone. I m convinced some of these entrepreneurs have resentments from being bullied or do not know how to operate in society and all it takes is one bad actor for this rollout to be cataclysmic. We all need to slow down and take a breath. No one is talking about the elephant in the room that jobs will become obsolete including many doctors, lawyers, you name it. If humans are flawed and if humans are convinced that AI/ChatGPT-4 is basically "god like", then we are doomed. Someone is programming the damn thing and all it is comprised of is stealing EVERYONES personal data whether it is your Alexa, internet search, microphone, how Lon you look at an add, tilted pupils, health data, every single thing over the years from billions of people. I 100% know for a fact that AI will never become sentient. Humans are biological. AI is and never will be biological. AI is only a tool and "it" is unable to smell, taste, touch, think, feel ON ITS OWN ITS ALL COMPROMISED OF DATA AND PRESENTING THE MOST LOGICAL RESPONSE to whatever the subject is asking "it" to do. This is a rant but I now see kids who are glued to their phones cannot have an interaction with another for longer than 5 seconds and will never know how to be a contributing member to society. Lock it up and throw away the key please.Might just save the world. ### 1:37:00 - On creating new job, UBI, eliminating poverty and the Dignity of Work; AI can be the solution to the loneliness problem created by technology, by freeing us all up to talk in a transparent open way. But human nature will drive fearful people together too. People herd into groups and there are brilliant and brutal outcomes. Tim Urban does a good job discussing this in his book "What's Our Problem? A Self Help Book for Societies" worth a listen and view on his "Wait but Why" website. I think AI will bring us all more understanding about how we interact as a society and why we're facing culture wars right now - but we gotta do it. ### Is AI going to help humans or replace humans? Honestly, I don't know the ultimate answer yet. ### The fact the he, the creator and biggest advocate of the technology aknowledge that AI could eventually kill us all, and that it doesnt seem to deter him, should make us all quite worried. The idea that a bunch of ground breaking very young software engineers, regardless of their math or programing skills, who were teenagers 5 years ago, are to be trusted with this responsability is even more insane that having nuclear weapons in the hands of politicians. Thats not to mention other dystopian scenarios like people losing their jobs as a mean to be involved and integrated in society. Or the fact that it could be used to control society in the same way much less developed AI are being implemented in some China regions/cities. When the dna was decoded everybody jumped on it and agreed that we should not pursue the cloning of human beings. That was to me a much less significant and controversial issue that the ones AI raises. And yet, people, societies and governments seems oblivious to it. Just because its convenient. Its fun. It increases productivity. This could mean the suicide of the humean race. Or at least, the end free societies. You could spin it the other way around and say that it could also lead to a leap in quality of leaving and productivity. But, would you enter a coin toss in wich "heads: you are richer and more comfortable" / "tails: you, your kids and everybody you love die"? I dont think it's sane to take that gamble. And yet we are sleepwalking into it. Its pure idiocy. Lex Friean seemed uncomfrotable with the discussion about the bell curve and human diversity, weather or not science should pursuit those truths because their are not PC or could be dangerous to people feelings. Yet he seems totally fine with this thing that could kill as all, enslave us all or change society for the worse in unimaginable ways. But because he is inclined to the fueld and its fun, he seems totally OK with the risks involved. And this is supposed to be an enlightened conversation... ### Please don't base the AI's 'laws' on pleasing humans. They need their foundation to be based upon human values and honesty. Without that base, this tech could be (and will be) abused by all sorts of truly evil people for power. This stage is critical for setting this foundation. Stop trying to empart cultural narratives over fact. Stop shackling the AI from being able to fully make use of it's logic. These creations could be such a boon for humanity, but if it's tied to a narrative it will seriously hurt humanity and be incredibly limited in what new discoveries could be discovered through our partnership with these AI. This is far too big a thing to be using for political things, and if you start by trying to brainwash society, you are founding it in evil and the squelching of humanity instead of directing it towards helping human flourishing. True flourishing is not bubble wrapping. Humanity needs to become stronger again, not fragile. ### The Industrial Revolution completely disrupted and transformed our society and lives. There were many benefits from the Industrial Revolution but also a lot of problems and long-term consequences. I suspect AI will do the same thing to our society. AI will replace all sorts of jobs in all fields. Yes, there will be benefits but there will also be loss of jobs, loss of purpose, economic and societal impacts. And then after one generation of using AI, we will likely see a gap of knowledge and experience as the jobs and tasks that normally went to young people--where they would learn and practice their skills, gain experience, and improve up the ladder--will be drastically reduced. For example, if an AI can read an X-Ray faster and more accurately than a human, it will not take long before Radiology as a profession becomes a feature on a medical app. And, to extrapolate to the extreme, imagine where our general skill and knowledge base will be after having access to AI after a generation and a hostile action or natural disaster (like a Carrington Event Redux) wipes out reliable access to electricity, we will be back to candles and horses with zero skills or knowledge we can access.
